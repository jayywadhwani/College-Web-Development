        <h1>What is TCP/IP Model ?</h1>
        <p>The TCP/IP model, standing for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a foundational framework
            governing the communication between devices over a network. Comprising four layers—Application, Transport,
            Internet, and Link—the TCP/IP model serves as the backbone of modern internet communication protocols. At
            the Application layer, various software applications interact with users and access network services. The
            Transport layer ensures reliable data delivery between hosts through protocols like TCP (Transmission
            Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The Internet layer facilitates the transmission of data
            packets across interconnected networks, with IP (Internet Protocol) handling addressing and routing.
            Finally, the Link layer deals with physical connections, defining standards for data transmission over local
            networks. This modular architecture provides flexibility and scalability, enabling the seamless exchange of
            information across diverse networks, forming the basis of the internet as we know it today.

        <h1>What is OSI Model ?</h1>
        <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the
            functions of networking systems. Comprised of seven layers—Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session,
            Presentation, and Application—the OSI model delineates the tasks required for successful communication
            between devices on a network. At the Physical layer, hardware components establish and maintain the physical
            connection, transmitting raw data in the form of electrical signals or light pulses. The Data Link layer
            manages the reliable transmission of data frames across a single link, ensuring error detection and
            correction. The Network layer oversees the routing of data packets through interconnected networks,
            utilizing logical addressing and routing protocols. The Transport layer ensures end-to-end delivery of data,
            offering both reliable and connectionless communication through protocols like TCP and UDP. The upper
            layers—Session, Presentation, and Application—handle session management, data formatting, and user
            interaction, respectively. While the OSI model provides a comprehensive framework for understanding network
            communication, it's often used as a reference model rather than a strict implementation guideline in
            practice, with TCP/IP being the dominant protocol suite used in modern networks.</p>
